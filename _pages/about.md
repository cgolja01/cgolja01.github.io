I (she/her) am a sixth year PhD candidate in the Keith Group at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Science. I study Solar Radiation Management (SRM), or the intentional manipulation of the Earth's radiative budget to lower climate risks associated with increasing atmospheric green house gas concentrations. Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI), is a proposed method of SRM in which a layer of reflective particles, aerosols, are intentionally added to high layers of the atmosphere to reflect sunlight back to space. 

I've been in the greater Boston area since beginning my undergraduate degreee at Tufts University, recieving a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering in 2015. Following graduation I spent a year as a consultant with Navigant, now Guidehouse, consulting, where I worked on technical documents for the U.S. Department of Energy's energy efficiency standards for consumer appliances. In my free time I love to run, ski, and surf all over New England!


Research Interests 
======
I use both global climate models and high resolution plume scale models to understand the implications of SAI. My initial PhD work supported design of the Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx), a balloon platform proposed to generate and sample a stratospheric aerosol plume. To understand how particles might behave in a balloon wake, I coupled a numerical advection/diffusion and aerosol microphysical model. 

My current work focuses on understanding the impact of stratospheric heating on policy relevant surface variables and changes to stratospheric dynamics. I'm broadly interested in understanding physical mechanisms driving differences in model representations of stratospheric phenomena to understand and improve future projections of global dynamics in the context of climate change. 


Ethical Statement
======

SAI is an understandibly controversial topic, and as I researcher I've continuously grappled with my own ethical believes regarding both research and deployment of this technology. I currently believe the slow rate of emissions cuts and tedious domestic political movement to impose meaningful climate policy motivate me to study this topic. However, I am by no means a proponent of deployment. I seek to critically examine the real tradeoffs and potential harms of this technology such that any future decision maker has enough information to make an informed decision.
